Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Steps/Decisions:

- First I decided to use **Next.js** framework because it has built in routing feature;
- Also I decided to use **MUI** to help me with **grids**, **modals**(contact modal) and **theming**(Emotion);
- Then I started doing the base layout(fonts, theme, header, layout base);

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Steps/Decisions:

- 1) I decided to use **Next.js** framework because it has built in routing feature;
- 2) I decided to use **MUI** to help me with **grids**, **modals**(contact modal) and **theming**(Emotion);
- 3) Then I started doing the base(fonts, theme, header, default layout);
- 4) Posts List (only front-end);

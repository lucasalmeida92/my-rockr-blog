## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Steps/Decisions:

1) I decided to use **Next.js** framework because it has built in routing feature, building/exporting project and lint;
2) I decided to use **MUI** to help me with **grids**, **modals**(contact modal), **theming** and **styling components**(*Emotion*);
3) Then I started doing the base(fonts, theme, header, default layout);
4) Posts List (front-end only);
5) Fetch Posts List;
6) Post Page;
7) Contact Modal;
8) Infinite scroll in Home Page(Posts);
9) Review and Little Adjustments.
